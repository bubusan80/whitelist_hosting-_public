#Whitelist for Pi-hole (https://pi-hole.net/) and Nebulo (https://github.com/Ch4t4r/Nebulo - only txt file is used).
#The script whitelist.sh for pihole, is based on script created by: GSolone (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gioxx/ph-whitelist/master/scripts/whitelist.sh).
#The anudeepND whitelist (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/whitelist/master/domains/whitelist.txt) is used in my file: whitelist.sh.
#The file "whitelist_full.txt" , "whitelist_base.txt" and files present in the "In_base_al_servizio" directory were mainly created using the pihole personally,- 
#-or taken from reported sources (for example for disneyplus which comes from OpenDns), or even from public reports present on https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/
