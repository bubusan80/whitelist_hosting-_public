Whitelist for Pi-hole (https://pi-hole.net/) and Nebulo (https://github.com/Ch4t4r/Nebulo - only txt file is used).<br></br>
The script whitelist.sh and whitelist_singole_abilitazioni.sh for pihole, are based on script created by: GSolone (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gioxx/ph-whitelist/master/scripts/whitelist.sh).<br></br>

The files present in the "In_base_al_servizio" directory were mainly created using the pihole personally, 
or taken from reported sources (for example for disneyplus which comes from OpenDns), or even from public reports present on https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/
